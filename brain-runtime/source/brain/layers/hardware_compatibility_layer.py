- Active layer: Hardware Compatibility Layer
- Layer file: app/brain/layers/hardware_compatibility_layer.py

#### Direct answer / severity
The official PCIe 3.0 x4 Dual NVMe Adapter is intended to support two NVMe SSDs on ZimaBoard 2 without user-configured PCIe bifurcation.

For a ZFS mirror, do not create the mirror until both NVMe drives are confirmed visible and stable in ZimaOS.

#### Verified facts
- ZimaBoard 2 has a PCIe 3.0 x4 expansion slot.
- The official dual NVMe adapter is designed for two NVMe M.2 SSDs.
- No user BIOS bifurcation setting should be required for the official adapter path.

#### Not verified yet
- Whether this specific user has the official adapter installed.
- Whether both NVMe drives are detected by the OS.
- Whether either NVMe drive has errors, disconnects, or unstable links.
- Whether the user already has data on either drive.

#### Next safest step
Run these checks before creating any ZFS mirror:

```bash
lspci -tv
nvme list
lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,MODEL,TYPE,MOUNTPOINTS
```

Optional stability check:

```bash
dmesg | grep -Ei 'nvme|pcie|aer|reset|timeout|error'
```

#### Safe recommendation
If both NVMe drives appear correctly in nvme list and lsblk, then a ZFS mirror is technically possible.

Do not create or format any mirror until disk identity is confirmed. ZFS mirror creation can destroy existing data if the wrong devices are selected.

#### Forum-ready summary
The official ZimaBoard 2 dual NVMe adapter should support two NVMe SSDs without user-configured PCIe bifurcation. Before creating a ZFS mirror, first confirm both NVMe drives are visible with nvme list and lsblk.

### {question.strip()}

#### Verification status
@@VERIFY:NOT VERIFIED@@ ❌ GUIDANCE ONLY / NOT VERIFIED FROM CURRENT REPORT
- Active layer: Hardware Compatibility Layer
- Layer file: app/brain/layers/hardware_compatibility_layer.py

#### Direct answer / severity
This is a hardware compatibility question. ZimaBrain should not guess hardware support without official hardware facts, a verified test report, or local system evidence.

#### Detected hardware topic
Possible hardware compatibility issue:
- PCIe / NVMe / SATA / NIC / GPU / HBA / USB / boot device / RAID / ZFS

#### Not verified yet
- Exact Zima device model.
- Exact accessory or PCIe card model.
- Whether the hardware is detected by ZimaOS.
- Whether kernel logs show errors.
- Whether the device is safe to use for storage, boot, VM passthrough, or RAID/ZFS.

#### Next safest step
Collect local evidence first:

```bash
lspci -nn
lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,MODEL,TYPE,MOUNTPOINTS
dmesg | grep -Ei 'pcie|nvme|sata|ahci|hba|raid|gpu|i915|nvidia|realtek|intel|usb|error|reset|timeout'
```

For NVMe-specific questions:

```bash
nvme list
```

For network card questions:

```bash
ip link
ethtool -i eth0 2>/dev/null || true
```

#### Safe recommendation
Do not recommend hardware as supported until the hardware is confirmed by official documentation, a verified test report, or local detection evidence.

#### Forum-ready summary
This is a hardware compatibility question. Please confirm the exact device/card model and provide lspci -nn, lsblk, and relevant dmesg output before relying on it for storage, boot, RAID/ZFS, or passthrough.
